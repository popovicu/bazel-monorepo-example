# Bazel monorepo example

**This repo is meant to accompany the article at http://popovicu.com/posts/build-all-software-in-one-command-with-bazel**

The monorepo available here is an example of how you can manage complex, multi-language builds uniformly within a project with Bazel. Bazelisk wrappers are included with the repository so you don't even have to install Bazel in order to play with this example! Check out the article for the details.
